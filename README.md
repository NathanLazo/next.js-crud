# NextJS CRUD proyect

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) application built using Next.js, a JavaScript framework for building server-rendered React applications. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on a database of items, with functionality to add new items, view a list of all items, update existing items, and delete items. The project also includes user authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can perform CRUD operations. The application is built with a modern tech stack including Next.js, React, Node.js, and API REST.
